# Meeting-Scheduling-App
The Meeting Info is a project to showcase a simple android application. This is implemented using Java Language 
with a graphic software system, android Studio. In this project we will Develop a content provider application with 
an activity called “Meeting Schedule” which takes Date, Time and Meeting Agenda as input from the user and store 
this information into the SQLite database. Create another application with an activity called “Meeting Info” having 
Date Picker control, which on the selection of a date should display the Meeting Agenda information for that 
particular date, else it should display a toast message saying “No Meeting on this Date”
